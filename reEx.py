"""The re.compile() function is used to precompile a regular expression
pattern, creating a regular expression object that can be used for
pattern matching. This can be useful in situations where the same
regular expression will be used multiple times, as it allows the
pattern to be compiled once, and then used repeatedly,
rather than having to recompile the pattern each time it is used.

Additionally, compile() can take some optional parameters like
re.IGNORECASE,
re.DOTALL,
re.MULTILINE and so on, that allow you to define how
the regular expression should behave.
